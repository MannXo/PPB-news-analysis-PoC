# PPB Humanitarian News Coverage Analysis: Proof of Concept

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze media coverage of humanitarian crises, particularly armed conflicts, across various news outlets. By examining the patterns, biases, and trends in news coverage, we seek to understand how media attention is distributed among different conflicts and how various factors influence this coverage.

## Data Collection

### Current Approach
- Data collected through scraping Google News RSS feeds
- Time frame: Last 12 months
- Sources: Specified news outlets
- Data points: Article titles, publication dates, outlets

### Caveats and Future Improvements
- Large-scale scraping may violate compliance regulations
- For MVP or actual product, consider switching to paid APIs
- Full text of articles not currently scraped due to processing limitations
- Analysis based on article titles only


## Data Cleaning

### Current Status
- Basic filtering implemented

### Future Improvements
- Fine-tune filtering to exclude unrelated news articles
- Implement more sophisticated natural language processing techniques to improve relevance detection

### Rationale
Proper data cleaning ensures that the analysis focuses on relevant content, reducing noise and improving the accuracy of insights derived from the data.

## Analysis and Visualizations

1. **Overall Conflict Coverage**
   - Provides a high-level view of which conflicts receive the most media attention
   
2. **Monthly Conflict Coverage**
   - Reveals temporal patterns and trends in coverage

3. **Coverage by Outlet**
   - Highlights potential biases or focus areas of different news sources

4. **Coverage by Country**
   - Depicts geographical patterns in conflict reporting

5. **Conflict Coverage Volatility vs Trend**
   - Indicates which conflicts have steady coverage versus those with more sporadic attention

6. **Conflict Coverage Intensity vs Consistency**
   - Demonstrates the depth and regularity of coverage for each conflict

7. **Seasonal Coverage Percentage**
   - Uncovers potential seasonal patterns in conflict reporting

8. **Day of Week Coverage Percentage**
   - Reveals weekly patterns in news publishing about conflicts

9. **Outlet Gini Coefficient by Conflict**
   - Measures the inequality in coverage across different outlets for each conflict

### Rationale
These analyses provide a multi-faceted view of conflict coverage, allowing for the identification of patterns, biases, and trends across various dimensions (time, geography, news sources). The use of statistical measures like volatility, trend analysis, and Gini coefficients adds rigor to the qualitative insights.

## Interpretation Guide

This guide provides direction on how to interpret the results of each analysis and visualization:

1. **Overall Conflict Coverage**
   - Higher bars indicate conflicts receiving more media attention
   - Significant disparities in bar heights may suggest biased or disproportionate coverage across conflicts

2. **Monthly Conflict Coverage**
   - Spikes in the graph may correspond to significant events related to specific conflicts
   - Consistent high coverage suggests ongoing media interest
   - Gradual increases or decreases may indicate evolving importance of a conflict in media narratives

3. **Coverage by Outlet**
   - Darker colors in the heatmap indicate higher coverage percentages
   - Uniform color across a row suggests balanced coverage by that outlet
   - Stark differences in color within a column may indicate outlet bias towards certain conflicts

4. **Coverage by Country**
   - Longer bars for a country suggest it gives more attention to conflict reporting overall
   - Variations in bar composition show different focus areas for each country's media

5. **Conflict Coverage Volatility vs Trend**
   - High volatility (x-axis) suggests inconsistent coverage over time
   - Positive trend values (higher on y-axis) indicate increasing coverage over time
   - Conflicts in the upper-right quadrant are gaining attention but with inconsistent coverage
   - Conflicts in the lower-left quadrant have steady but potentially declining coverage

6. **Conflict Coverage Intensity vs Consistency**
   - High intensity (x-axis) indicates more articles per day on average
   - High consistency (y-axis) suggests regular coverage over time
   - Conflicts in the upper-right quadrant receive both frequent and regular coverage
   - Conflicts in the lower-left quadrant might be underreported or only sporadically covered

7. **Seasonal Coverage Percentage**
   - Darker colors in certain seasons may indicate temporal patterns in conflict reporting
   - Consistent color across seasons for a conflict suggests stable year-round coverage
   - Stark seasonal differences might reflect how conflict dynamics or media interest change with seasons

8. **Day of Week Coverage Percentage**
   - Darker colors on specific days may reveal patterns in when conflict news is published
   - Consistent color across the week suggests evenly distributed coverage
   - Noticeable patterns (e.g., darker weekends) might reflect editorial decisions or news consumption habits

9. **Outlet Gini Coefficient by Conflict**
   - Higher Gini coefficients (taller bars) suggest more unequal coverage across outlets
   - A high Gini coefficient might indicate that a conflict is reported disproportionately by a small number of outlets
   - Lower Gini coefficients suggest more balanced coverage across different news sources


## Conclusion

This project serves as a proof of concept by demonstrating:

1. The feasibility of collecting and analyzing large-scale news data on conflict coverage
2. The potential for uncovering meaningful patterns and insights through various analytical approaches
3. The ability to visualize complex data in an accessible and informative manner

## Future Considerations for MVP and Actual Product

1. Implement paid API solutions for more comprehensive and compliant data collection
2. Incorporate full-text analysis of articles for deeper insights
3. Enhance data cleaning and filtering processes
4. Develop more sophisticated analytical models (machine learning, NLP, etc.)
5. Develop a more interactive and customizable dashboard for end-users
